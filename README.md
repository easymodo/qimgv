# User interface

The idea is to have a uncluttered, simple and easy to use UI. You can see UI elements only when you need them.

There is a pull-down panel with thumbnails, as well as folder view. You can also bring up a context menu via right click.

## Using quick copy / quick move panels

Bring up the panel with C or M shortcut. You will see 9 destination directories, click on the folder icon to change them.

With panel visible, use 1 - 9 keys to copy/move current image to corresponding directory.

When you are done press C or M again to hide the panel.

## Running scripts

You can run custom scripts on a current image.

Open __Settings > Scripts__. Press Add. Here you can choose between a shell command and a shell script. 

Example of a command: 

`convert %file% %file%_.pdf`

Example of a shell script file (`$1` will be image path): 
```
#!/bin/bash
gimp "$1"
```
_Note: The script file must be an executable. Also, "shebang" (`#!/bin/bash`) needs to be present._

When you've created your script go to __Settings > Controls > Add__, then select it and assign a shortcut like for any regular action.

## HiDPI (Linux / MacOS only)

If qimgv appears too small / too big on your display, you can override the scale factor. Example:
```
QT_SCALE_FACTOR="1.5" qimgv /path/to/image.png
```
You can put it in `qimgv.desktop` file to make it permanent. Using values less than `1.0` is not supported.

qimgv should also obey the global scale factor set in KDE's systemsettings.

## High quality scaling

qimgv supports nicer scaling filters when compiled with `opencv` support (ON by default, but might vary depending on your linux distribution). Filter options are available in __Settings > Scaling__. `Bicubic` or `bilinear+sharpen` is recommended.

# Additional image formats

qimgv can open some extra formats via third-party image plugins. All of them are included with windows package.

| JPEG-XL | [github.com/novomesk/qt-jpegxl-image-plugin](https://github.com/novomesk/qt-jpegxl-image-plugin) |
